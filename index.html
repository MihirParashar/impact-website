        <p>
          In recent years, carbon emissions have become increasingly dangerous
          to Earthâ€™s ecosystem and environment. Consequently, countries around
          the world have been putting in measures to counteract excessive carbon
          emissions and help reduce carbon emissions. However, access to these
          technologies is expensive, and low-income areas may not be able to
          reduce their carbon footprint. Understanding the correlation between
          household income and carbon footprint is crucial to reducing
          inequalities and creating sustainable communities, fulfilling the
          United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11. This research project
          aims to determine the correlation, if any, between the average
          household income and the average carbon footprint of a geographical
          area. It is hypothesized that lower-income areas will have higher
          average carbon footprints due to factors such as inefficient housing,
          reliance on fossil fuels, and limited access to sustainable
          infrastructure. The research will utilize publicly available datasets
          on household income and carbon emissions by county and ZIP code. Using
          the results, a solution can be proposed to decrease the overall carbon
          footprint by specifically targeting the areas with a higher carbon
          footprint through cheap, preventative software.
