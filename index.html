                In recent years, carbon emissions have become increasingly
                dangerous to Earth’s ecosystem and environment. Consequently,
                countries around the world have been putting in measures to
                counteract excessive carbon emissions and help reduce carbon
                emissions. However, access to these technologies is expensive,
                and low-income areas may not be able to reduce their carbon
                footprint. Understanding the correlation between household
                income and carbon footprint is crucial to reducing inequalities
                and creating sustainable communities, fulfilling the United
                Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11. This research project
                aims to determine the correlation, if any, between the average
                household income and the average carbon footprint of a
                geographical area. It is hypothesized that lower-income areas
                will have higher average carbon footprints due to factors such
                as inefficient housing, reliance on fossil fuels, and limited
                access to sustainable infrastructure. The research will utilize
                publicly available datasets on household income and carbon
                emissions by county and ZIP code. Using the results, a solution
                can be proposed to decrease the overall carbon footprint by
                specifically targeting the areas with a higher carbon footprint
                through cheap, preventative software.

                This project was created by a team of high school students at
                the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy interested in
                mitigating the effects of climate change. These students have
                taken an interest in environmental protection and health from a
                young age. Given the opportunity, they chose to pursue this
                project regarding the exploration of climate change in a
                substantive and multilayered manner.<br />
                Climate change refers to the long-term increase in global
                average temperature and changes in weather patterns. While
                Earth's climate has varied naturally over millions of years, the
                new era of rapid warming began in the late 19th century, during
                the Industrial Revolution. That's when carbon dioxide (CO₂)
                emissions skyrocketed as factories and cars began spewing
                greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at unprecedented levels.
                Scientific consensus confirms that these emissions are trapping
                heat and accelerating global warming, which is causing sea
                levels to rise and weather events to become more extreme. This
                can have a disastrous effect on the environment by increasing
                the frequency of natural disasters and making habitats
                uninhabitable for many species. Research proves that climate
                change is directly influenced by human activity, especially
                through carbon emissions. <br />
                This project aims to help researchers understand how economic
                factors influence carbon emissions over geographical areas. We
                intend to explore a potential correlation between the average
                household income nationwide in the United States and the average
                carbon emissions in this domain. <br />
